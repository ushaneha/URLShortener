# URL Shortener Application Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/ushaneha/URLShortener.git`

`$ cd URLShortener`


Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

`$ pip install virtualenv`

`$ virtualenv django-env`

`$ django-env\Scripts\activate`


Note the (django-env) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by virtualenv.
Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies:

`(django-env)$ python manage.py runserver`

And navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
